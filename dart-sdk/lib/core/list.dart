/**
 * A [List] is an indexable collection with a length.
 *
 * A `List` implementation can choose not to support all methods
 * of the `List` interface.
 *
 * The most common list types are:
 * * Fixed length list. It is an error to use operations that can change
 *   the list's length.
 * * Growable list. Full implementation of the interface.
 * * Unmodifiable list. It is an error to use operations that can change
 *   the list's length, or that can change the values of the list.
 *   If an unmodifable list is backed by another modifiable data structure,
 *   the values read from it may still change over time.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *    var fixedLengthList = new List(5);
 *    fixedLengthList.length = 0;  // throws.
 *    fixedLengthList.add(499);  // throws
 *    fixedLengthList[0] = 87;
 *    var growableList = [1, 2];
 *    growableList.length = 0;
 *    growableList.add(499);
 *    growableList[0] = 87;
 *    var unmodifiableList = const [1, 2];
 *    unmodifiableList.length = 0;  // throws.
 *    unmodifiableList.add(499);  // throws
 *    unmodifiableList[0] = 87;  // throws.
